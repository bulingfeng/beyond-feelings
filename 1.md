Why we need beyond feelings?

> 我们为什么要超越情感？

Feeling and thought are perfectly complementary. Feeling, being more spontaneous, is an excellent beginning to the development of conclusions. And thought, being more deliberate, provides a way to identify the best and most appropriate feeling. Both are natural.Thinking, however, is less automatic than feeling. To do it well demands a systematic approach and guided practice.

> 情感和想法是完美的互补。情感更多的是来自自发，对于结论的的发展是一个好的开始。想法更多的来自认真考虑，它能辨别出最适合的情感。两者都是天生的。然而**思想**却比情感更少。把事情做好需要一个系统的方法和指导性的练习。

When the first edition of this book appeared in 1975, the dominant intellectual focus was still subjectivity, feelings. That focus, the legacy of the 1960s, was originally a necessary reaction to the rationalism and behaviorism that preceded it. Yet, despite its value, the focus on feelings went too far. Like many other movements, what began as a reaction against an extreme view became an extreme view itself.

> 这本书的第一版出现在1975年的时候，支配的智力依然是主观的情感。注意力，来自20世纪60年代的遗留物，对于先钱的理性派和行为派都是必须的反应。还有，尽管在情感上的价值和注意力越来越远。像其他时刻一样，开始反应的事物反对一个极端的观点，然后它自己也变成了一个极端的观点。

First, because we live in an age of manipulation. Armies of hucksters and demagogues stand ready with the rich resources of psychology to play upon our emotions and subconscious needs to persuade us that superficial is profound, harmful is beneficial, evil is virtuous. And feelings are especially vulnerable to such manipulation.

>首先，因为我们生活在一个操控的时代。商贩和政客占有很多心里资源来玩弄我们的情感并且潜意识说服我们肤浅是很好的，伤害是有益的，仇恨是品德高尚的。对于这样的操作情况是如此的脆弱。

Secondly, because in virtually every important area of modern life—law, medicine, government, education, science, business, and community affairs—we are beset with serious problems and complex issues that demand careful gathering and weighing of facts and informed opinions, thoughtful consideration of various conclusions or actions, and judicious selection of the best conclusion or most appropriate action

> 第二，因为实际上每个现代重要的生活区域-法律，医学，政府，教育，科学，商业和社区事务。我们被严肃和复杂的问题所困扰。这些问题需要仔细的收集和谨慎评估事实和有见解的观点，慎重思考多种结论和行为，最好的结论的谨慎选择或者最合理的行为。

The Influence of Time and Place

1 Not only are you a member of a particular species, Homo sapiens , but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that species and in a particular place on the planet. That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns.

2 Living in a different age or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and place, they still would represent the context of your life—in other words, they still would influence your responses

>
> 2. 生活在不同的时代和文化能是你变成一个不同的人。即使你对你的时间和地点很反叛，它们任然会提现在你的生活中，换句话说，它们依然会影响你做出的反应。

The Influence of Ideas

1 When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably. In logic, this kinship is expressed by the term sequitur, Latin for “it follows.”Consider, for example, the idea that many teachers and parents express to young children as a way of encouraging them: “If you believe in yourself, you can succeed at anything.” From this it follows that nothing else but belief—neither talent nor hard work—is necessary for success. The reason the two ideas are equivalent is that their meanings are inseparably linked.

The Influence of Mass Culture

1 Modern advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials by celebrities. This approach is designed to appeal to emotions and create artificial needs for products and services. As a result, many people develop the habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to such appeals. Ads often portray play as more fulfilling than work, self-gratification as more desirable than self-control, and materialism as more meaningful than idealism.

2 The number of shifts within commercials ranged from 6 to 54 and averaged approximately 17 per fifteen-second commercial. The total number of attention shifts came out to over 800 per hour, or over 14 per minute.

This manipulation has prevented many people from developing a mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the workplace to provide the same constant excitement they get from television. That, of course, is an impossible demand, and when it isn’t met they call their teachers boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom have the patience to read books that require them to think, many publishers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.

> 1. 现在广告轰炸这公共，用名人的标语和奖品。这个方式被设计唤起情感并且对产品和服务创造人为的需要。结果许多人养成一个情绪化的，冲动的答复习惯，并且是亲信的对这种呼唤。广告更容易描绘出来满足比工作更好，自我向往的满足比自控更好，并且功利主义比理性主义更有意义。

The “Science” of Manipulation

1 Attempts to influence the thoughts and actions of others are no doubt as old as time, but manipulation did not become a science until the early twentieth century, when Ivan Pavlov, a Russian professor of psychology, published his research on conditioned (learned) reflexes. Pavlov found that by ringing a bell when he fed a dog, he could condition the dog to drool at the sound of the bell even when no food was presented”

2 The more people hear a slogan or talking point, the more familiar it becomes. Before long, it becomes indistinguishable from ideas developed through careful thought. Sadly, the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a DVD into a DVD player. He then pushes a button and ‘plays back’ the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.

> 操作的"科学"

> 1. 尝试着去影响那些人的想法和行动，毫无疑问在以前就有。但是操作没有变成一个科学直到20世纪初期，直到一个俄国心理学专家Pavlov发布了他的对条件反射的研究。Pavlov发现每当当给狗喂食物的时候就响铃铛，他能使狗流口水靠那个铃铛的声音，即使还没有食物。
> 2. 人们听到的标语或者论点越多，它就变得越来越熟悉。长期以后，它变的语深思熟虑的想法无法分辨。不幸的是，打包被经常的这么做是如此的有效以至于观察者，倾听者，阅读者一点都不能掌控他们自己的大脑。取而代之，他插入一个打包好的想法进入他的大脑，有点想DVD插入到DVD Player。他按按钮回放观点，虽然好像很适合这么做。他这么做没有任何的思考。

The Influence of Psychology

1 According to Frankl, the primordial anthropological fact is that being human is being always directed, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love.A person becomes fully human “by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.

2  Whether we agree completely with Frankl, one thing is clear: Contemporary American culture would be markedly different if the emphasis over the past several decades had been on Frankl’s theory rather than on the theories of Maslow and the other humanistic psychologists.

> 心理的影响
>
> 1. 根据Frankl，原始的人类学事实上人类总是很直接。指责某件事或者某个人而不是自己。意味着对于满足或者其他人很容易遇到。一个人变成一个完整的人"靠忘记他自己和给予他自己，审视他自己和注意外观形象"。
> 2. 无论我们是否完全同意Frankl，一件事情非常明确：如果过去几十年的影响在Frankl的理论上而不是在Maslow的理论上和其他的人文学家，同时代的美国的文化将会被深深的影响。

being an Individual

In light of what we have discussed, we should regard individuality not as something we are born with but rather as something acquired—or, more precisely, earned. Individuality begins in the realization that it is impossible to “escape being influenced by other people and by circumstance. The essence of individuality is ‘vigilance. The following guidelines will help you achieve this:”



1. Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative.No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until you have examined it.
2. Decide why you reacted as you did. Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else—a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.
3. Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or situation.
4. Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction.

> 1. 对任何人，问题，情况的首次反应作为一个暂定。无论如何都要拒绝拥抱它，直到你已经调查过它。
> 2. 考虑一下你做出的反应。考虑下你是否持有一些其他反应-反应来自其他人你的父母或者朋友，或许还是一个明星或者电视上虚构的角色。如果可能的话，查明你这个反应的具体经历来自哪里。
> 3. 思考下你可能对其他人，问题和情况有的反应。
> 4. 反问一下自己，是否其他反应是更合适的相比你的第一反应。
