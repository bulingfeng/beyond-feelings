How Good Are Your Opinions?

> 你的意见有多好？

To me truth is precious. . . . I should rather be right and stand alone than to run with the multitude and be wrong. . . . The holding of the views herein set forth has already won for me the scorn and contempt and ridicule of some of my fellow men. I am looked upon as being odd, strange, peculiar. . . . But truth is truth and though all the world reject it and turn against me, I will cling to truth still.”

> 对我来说真理是弥足珍贵的....相对于从主大众和自己是错的，我更应该是正确的和独立站立。拥有一些长远的观点对我来说已经赢了，赢了轻蔑，鄙视，和一类人的嘲弄。我被看做是古怪的，奇怪的，特别的...但是真理就是真理并且虽然全世界都在反对他和反对我,我仍然仅靠真理。

Free societies are based on the wise observation that people have an inalienable right to think their own thoughts and make their own choices. But this fact in no way suggests that the thoughts they think and the choices they make will be reasonable. 

> 自由的社会制度是基于明智的观察——人们有不可剥削的权利去思考他们自己的想法和做出他们自己的选择。但是实际上无法办法表明他们的想法和做出的决定是明智的。

It is a fundamental principle of critical thinking that ideas are seldom of equal quality. Solutions to problems vary from the practical to the impractical, beliefs from the well founded to the ill founded, arguments from the logical to the illogical, and opinions from the informed to the uninformed. Critical thinking serves to separate the more worthy from the less worthy and, ultimately, to identify the best.”

> 主意很少有相同的性质是独立思考的基本原则。解决问题的方法变化从实际到不实际，信仰从好的变为病态的，争论从逻辑性变为没有逻辑，并且观点从有见识的变为无见识的。独立思考能够从少有价值的事物中剥离出来更有价值的事物，最终辨别出最好的。

**Even Experts Can Be Wrong**

In 1890 a Nobel Prize–winning bacteriologist, Dr. Robert Koch, reported that he had found a substance that would cure tuberculosis .When it was injected into patients, though, it was found to cause further illness and even death.It is impossible to know what expert opinions of our time will be overturned by researchers in the future. But we can be sure that some will be. And they may well be views that today seem unassailable.

> **即使是专家也会犯错**

> 在1890年一个获取诺贝尔奖的细菌博士Robert Koch报道道他发现了一个东西能治疗肺结核。当药物被注射到病人体内，然而，被发现导致了后遗症甚至是死亡。我们那个时代的专家观点会被研究者推翻在未来是不可能知道的。但是我们确定一些将会是。并且今天来看那些观点好像是无懈可击的。

Some people, of course, are more prone to errors than others. English philosopher John Locke observed that these people fall into three groups: Those who seldom reason at all, but think and act as those around them do—parents, neighbors, the clergy, or anyone else they admire and respect. Such people want to avoid the difficulty that accompanies thinking for themselves.Those who are determined to let passion rather than reason govern their lives. Those people are influenced only by reasoning that supports their prejudices .Those who sincerely follow reason, but lack sound, overall good sense, and so do not look at all sides of an issue. They tend to talk with one type of person, read one type of book, and so are exposed to only one viewpoint.To Locke’s list we should add one more type: those who never bother to reexamine an opinion once it has been formed. These people are often the most error prone of all, for they forfeit all opportunity to correct mistaken opinions when new evidence arises.”

> 当然一些人是更容易犯错相比其他人。英国哲学家John Locke观察到这些人可以归为三组:一些人从来一点也不思考，但是他们想法和行动类似他们周围的人——父母，邻居，神职人员或者他们羡慕和尊敬的人。如此的人想要避免伴困难，这个困难对他们来说伴随着思考。那些人总是让他们的情绪治理他们的生活而非推理。那些人别影响仅仅被他们的偏见。那些人真诚地顺应那个原因，但是缺乏声音，覆盖好的感受，并且因此从来不看有问题的那面。他们倾向于于一类人交谈，读同一类型的书，并且因此总是暴露统一观点。对于 Locke的列表我们应该再添加一个类型：那些人他们从来不花费时间检验一个观点一旦观点形成。那些人总是最容易犯错，因为他们丧失所有的机会去核实错误的观点当新的证据出现的时候。

**Forming Opinions Responsibly**

1. Understand how opinions are formed.

2. Resist the temptation to treat your opinions as facts.

3. Monitor your thoughts to prevent the uncritical default mode from taking charge.

Whenever you begin forming impressions of a person, place, or situation, follow the advice of the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus: “Be not swept off your feet by the vividness of the impression, but say, ‘Impression, wait for me a little. Let me see what you are and what you represent. Let me try [test] you.’ ” This approach will prevent your impressions from hardening into opinions before you determine their reasonableness.

> 1. 理解观点是如何形成。

> 2. 抵制诱惑用事实去对待你的观点。
> 3. 监控你的观点去拒绝用默认的非批判模式去做讨论指责。
>
> 无论何时当你开始对某个人，地方，或者情况形成印象的时候，遵循古老的希腊哲学家Epictetus的建议："别清扫你脚下靠鲜艳的印象，而是说，印象，等我一会。让我看看你是什么样子和你描绘了什么。让我试着测试你下你"。这个方法将会阻止你的印象让你的观点变硬在你确定它们的合理性之前。
