What does it mean to know?

> 知道意味着什么？

knowing involves more than having the right answer. It also involves the realization that you have it.The issue may require understanding numerous details or complex principles or steps in a process. (It may also involve a skill—knowing how to do something）

> 知道需要更多比有正确的答案。它也需要你拥有认知。问题可能要求理解各种细节或者复杂的规则或者在一个进程中的步骤。(它可能也需要是一个技能-知道怎么做一些事情)

How to achieve knowledge?

> 如何获取知识？

1 We can achieve knowledge either actively or passively. We achieve it actively by direct experience, by testing and proving an idea (as in a scientific experiment), or by reasoning. When we do it by reasoning, we analyze a problem, consider all the facts and possible interpretations, and draw the logical conclusion.

> 我们能积极或者被动的获取知识。我们获取知识靠直截了当的经历，靠测试和证明一个想法（在科学实验中），或者靠推理。我们分析一个问题，考虑所有的情况和可能的说明，和提取出逻辑结论。

2 We achieve knowledge passively by being told something by someone else. Most of the learning that takes place in the classroom and the kind that happens when we watch TV news reports or read newspapers or magazines is passive. Unfortunately, passive learning has a serious defect. It makes us tend to accept uncritically what we are told even when what we are told is little more than hearsay and rumor.

> 我们被动地获取知识靠被其他人告知。学习的大部分需要在教室和这种学习方式发生当我们被动地观看新闻报道或者读新闻报纸或者杂志。不幸的是，被动学习有个严重的缺陷。它使我们趋向于不加批判地接受我们被告诉的事情，甚至当我们被告诉更多的是传闻和谣言。

Why Knowing Is Difficult

> 为何知道是如何困难？

One reason why knowing is difficult is that some long unanswered questions continue to resist solution.Another reason is that everyday situations arise for which there are no precedents .Still another reason why knowing is difficult is that, as one generation succeeds another, knowledge is often forgotten or unwisely rejected.

> 知道是如此困难的一个原因是一些没有答案的问题持续的阻止解决。另一个原因是每天的情况产生，这些情况是没有先例的。还有另一个为何知道是如此困难的原因是，当一代人成功了的另一个事件，知识经常被忘记或者愚蠢的拒绝。

 Before we discuss how knowledge is best sought, let’s consider two habits that impede knowledge: assuming and guessing. Assuming is taking something for granted—that is, arbitrarily accepting as true something that has not been proved or that may reasonably be disputed. The main negative effect of unrecognized assumptions is that they stifle the curiosity that leads to knowledge.

> 在我们讨论知识如何被最好的寻找之前，让我们来考虑两个习惯，这些习惯阻碍了知识：假定和猜测。假定是讨论一些事情给予了准许-那就是五段地接受作为一个事实，这个事实还没有被证明或者它还在被争论。未被认定的假定主要的消极影响是他们扼杀了通向知识的好奇心。

Guessing is offering a judgment on a hunch or taking a chance on an answer without any confidence that it is correct. Because assuming stifles curiosity and guessing denies the importance of evidence, neither is likely to lead to knowledge. 

> 猜想提供一个直觉判断或者带来一个机会关于一个没有任何正确的信心答案。因为假定扼杀好奇心，假定否定证据的重要性，不可能通向知识。

The most reliable approach is to be cautious in asserting that you know something. Be conservative in your level of assertion—whenever you are less than certain, speak about possibilities and probabilities. Say, “I think” or “It seems to me” rather than “I know.” Most important, be honest with yourself and others about your ignorance. To admit you don’t know something shows good sense, restraint, and intellectual honesty. These are not weaknesses but strengths. The admission of ignorance is the essential first step toward knowledge.

>最可靠的方法是在你做断言时候保持谨慎。你的主张要保持保守-无论何时都要保持少量的确信，在谈论关于可能性时候。说“我认为”或者“对我来说好像是”来代替说"我知道"。最重要的是，真诚对待自己和其他人关于你的不知情事情。承认你自己不知道的事情会让你感觉更好，更诚实。那不是示弱而是更有力量。承认自己不知情的事情是通向知识的第一步。
